## üîß Notes

- This tool is still new and may need improvements.
- Pin Folder will only work from the second column in Project tab it not effect first column folders. 
- Some parts of the code may still need rearrangement.
- Unity may cache tabs, so if colors/icons don‚Äôt update immediately, they will after restarting or re-build the code.
- Works best in Unity 2022+.
