1. Open the Tool:
   Go to `Window > Folder Tabs` to open the `Pin Folders` window.
2. Pin a Folder:
   Right-click a folder in the **Project window** and click **"Pin Folder"**.
   A new Project tab is created and pinned to that folder.

   Use the Folder Tabs window to rename, reorder, recolor, or re-icon your tabs.
   Right-click inside the window to Collapse All, Expand All, or Clear All.

## 🔧 Notes

- This tool is still new and may need improvements.
- Pin Folder will only work from the second column in Project tab it not effect first column folders. 
- Some parts of the code may still need rearrangement.
- Unity may cache tabs, so if colors/icons don’t update immediately, they will after restarting or re-build the code.
- Works best in Unity 2022+.
