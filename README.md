# Unity Pin Folders

A lightweight Unity Editor extension that lets you pin frequently used folders into custom tabs.  
Enhances focus and performance by reducing time spent navigating the Project window.

## ✨ Features

- Right-click any folder → **Pin Folder**
- Automatically opens a new **Project tab** named after the folder
- Custom tab colors and icons
- Tabs persist across Unity restarts
- Drag-and-drop to reorder tabs
- Context menu: Collapse All / Expand All / Delete All

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open Unity.
2. Right-click a folder in the **Project window** and click **"Pin Folder"**.
3. A new Project tab is created and pinned to that folder.
4. Open the **Folder Tabs** window from **Window → Folder Tabs** to manage your pins.

## 🔧 Notes

- This tool is still new and may need improvements.
- Some parts of the code may still need rearrangement.
- Unity may cache tabs, so if colors/icons don’t update immediately, they will after restarting or re-applying.
- Works best in Unity 2021+.
